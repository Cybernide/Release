One note about the "big three" folders of Debug, Release, and ReleaseAVX.

- Debug is where steersuite compiles to when in Debug mode

- Release is where steersuite compiles when in Release mode, all the Visual Studio bells and whistles have been set to try to compile the absolute fastest code we can.

32-bit builds dump into the same folders with the same names.  Please remember not to add build products to the repository.
